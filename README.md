# Brendan Portfolio

## Purpose
The purpose of this porftolio is to show potential employers the skills I have learnt and the projects and work that I have completed. It will be an easy to access location with all my work and contact information in one place.

## Goal

The goal of this portfolio will be a tool that can be used to potentially help land a full stack developer job. This website is a new adaptation on the [First Portfolio](https://bdjm94.github.io/02-brendan-portfolio/) that I first created in Week 2. It now includes Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript elements, as well as a new skills section. 

## Updates

### Nav Bar

The new Nav Bar takes advantage of Bootstrap and is now a collapsible nav bar when it goes to mobile view.

### Portfolio

The portfolio section starts with the projects. The projects use JavaScript to show a slideshow of images that link to the projects I have contributed to.

### Work

The assignments I worked on through the course are now displayed in a cleaner 3x3 grid. Each image has a hover function that shows the name of the work, a short description and then a button which links to the deployed page.

### About

The about section now has a small about me (to encourage employers) and then a 3x2 grid of the different skills that I have learnt (will learn) over the course of the Bootcamp. Each icon has a hover function which changes the CSS formatting.

### Contact

The contact section has been kept the same with the same icons that link to my email, phone, GitHub, LinkedIn and Instagram.
